**Hello!**
Thank you for visiting my personal web site. I hope you love it.
I spent sometime trying to make it look nice and have most important information about me. However I still think there are more things to do. I’m trying to work on it and other side projects while I’m not at work or not spending time with my family.
Currently I’m working as a Software Developer in Edmonton based digital development company. It’s a small company, but we are very busy there. That helps me to improve my current skills and learn something new every day.
If you are interested in what I’m doing please let me know. Or if you see something that can be improved, please contact me as well. It’s always interesting to hear other points of view. Or just saying `Hi` would be great as well.
