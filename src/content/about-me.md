#Hello!
Thank you for visiting my personal web site!
Iâ€™m Igor. If you wondering how do I look like check top left corner of the screen or visit my Linkedin page. :D Here I should say few words about myself... You could notice, that every page of this website has a header with some of my favourite quotes. I think these quotes describe me as a person (at least that what I think about myself :D).

I checked some other designer's personal websites and their websites look much simplier in term of functionality. This is was done in order to have some practise with React and Gatsby
