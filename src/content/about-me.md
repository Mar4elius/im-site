#Hello!
Thank you for visiting my personal web site!
Iâ€™m Igor. If you wondering how do I look like check top left corner of the screen or visit my Linkedin page. :D Here I should say few words about myself... You could notice, that every page of this website has a header with some of my favorite quotes. I think these quotes describe me as a person (at least that what I think about myself :D).

As you can see this site still needs some work to be done in order to be finished. I'm trying to do my best to create some content and fix know bugs for this site when I have time after my main job.
